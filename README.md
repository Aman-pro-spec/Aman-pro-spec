I'm Aman singh, a motivated third-year student majoring in ML at NIET Greater Noida.During my journey so far, I've been immersing myself in the world of Java Programming and exploring my passion for DSA and Front end development. I believe that learning never stops, and every challenge is an opportunity in disguise. With an insatiable curiosity, I'm eagerly looking forward to learn ML.
